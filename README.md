# A-Search-Algorithm
Visual demostration and implementation of the A* algorithm in Java.

The project shows an initial grid of (x,z) size with a random initial point (denoted by I) and a random final point (denoted by F) both in a red square, it also shows a set of 70 obstacles with random coordinates as black squares.

Then the project shows a small animation of how the algorithm is searching for a path. In this step, the different branch of the initial tree are shown as yellow squares with the distance calculated value inside, and with color blue the possible next step.

Finally, the best route selected by the algorithm is marked as a set of red border yellow squares and also marks the initial and final point with a red square.
